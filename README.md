# MNIST Classification with RAPIDS (cuDF & cuML)

This project demonstrates how to leverage NVIDIA RAPIDS libraries â€” **cuDF** and **cuML** â€” to accelerate machine learning workflows using GPUs. We compare the performance of Random Forest classification on the MNIST dataset using traditional **CPU-based Scikit-learn** and **GPU-accelerated cuML**.

## ðŸ”§ RAPIDS Overview

**RAPIDS** is an open-source suite of GPU-accelerated libraries designed to speed up data science workflows.

### ðŸ§® cuDF (GPU DataFrames)

- cuDF is the GPU-accelerated equivalent of `pandas`.
- It provides fast data manipulation using CUDA and NVIDIA GPUs.
- Syntax is nearly identical to `pandas`.

### ðŸ§  cuML (GPU Machine Learning)

- cuML is a library of GPU-accelerated machine learning algorithms.
- Implements common models like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, KMeans, PCA, etc.
- Scikit-learn compatible API for easy migration.
